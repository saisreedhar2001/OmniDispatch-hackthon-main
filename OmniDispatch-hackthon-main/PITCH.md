# 🎯 OmniDispatch - Hackathon Pitch Deck

## The Problem

Traditional emergency dispatch systems are **reactive** and suffer from:
- ❌ 3-5 second AI response latency
- ❌ No predictive intelligence
- ❌ Manual coordination between agencies
- ❌ Limited access to building information
- ❌ No historical pattern recognition

**Result:** Delayed response times that cost lives.

---

## Our Solution: OmniDispatch

**Predictive, not reactive. Sub-200ms AI reasoning. Coordinated multi-agent response.**

### The "Winning" Formula

```
Cerebras (Sub-200ms) + ElevenLabs (Voice) + CrewAI (Agents) + RAG (Knowledge) 
= Emergency Response at the Speed of Light
```

---

## 🧠 The Technology

### 1. Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
- **1,000+ tokens/second** inference
- **Sub-200ms** reasoning time
- Eliminates the lag that makes AI unusable in emergencies

### 2. Three Specialized AI Agents

#### Agent A: Empathetic Intake 🎙️
- Processes voice through ElevenLabs
- Analyzes stress levels in real-time
- Extracts critical information instantly

#### Agent B: Incident Historian 🧠
- Searches 1000s of historical incidents
- Retrieves building blueprints
- Identifies patterns across time and location

#### Agent C: Strategic Orchestrator 🎯
- Dispatches optimal units automatically
- Coordinates fire, police, medical
- Updates dashboards in real-time

### 3. RAG Knowledge Base
- **2,847 documents indexed**
- Building blueprints with 3D floor plans
- 2026-standard safety protocols
- Historical incident database

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. **Predictive Hotspotting**
AI analyzes historical data to identify risk zones:
- "3 smoke reports in 2-block radius = Fire Cluster Risk"
- Pre-position units before crisis escalates

### 2. **Temporal Correlation**
Real-time analysis of external factors:
- Weather impact on response times
- Traffic patterns during rush hour
- Time-of-day incident clustering

### 3. **Smart Blueprints**
Instant building intelligence:
- "Go to the left door on the 2nd floor"
- Real-time floor plan display for dispatchers
- Historical incident data per building

### 4. **Voice Stress Analysis**
ElevenLabs integration provides:
- Real-time stress level monitoring
- Automatic priority escalation
- Empathetic response adaptation

## 📊 The Pitch

> "Most emergency systems are reactive. OmniDispatch is predictive. By utilizing Cerebras' wafer-scale hardware, we've eliminated the 3-second latency gap that traditionally prevents AI from being used in life-or-death situations. Our agents hear a fire, verify it against building blueprints in our RAG vault, and coordinate the entire response team before the caller even hangs up."
